This web application is broken down into 3 pages- Index (About), Portfolio and Contact. 

Each page has an identical nav bar and footer, with only the main differing. The left side of the nav bar has my name inside of a rectangle, and on a small screen, the links change to a dropdown menu. Each page has a footer which is fixe to the bottom of the screen, only the content inside of the main sections differ. 

About page: The main section contains an image of me and some information about me. The text wraps around the image on an iPad or PC sized screen and is under the image on a mobile screen. 

Portfolio: This has 5 image links which consist of an image with text over the image and a gren background behind the text. Clicking anywhere will activate the link because everything is inside the a tags. The images are in rows of 2 on PC or iPad sized screens and rows of 1 on mobile screens, which is done my making the class col-md-6 col-12 so anything medium or larger will have the images taking up 6 columns. The first link is to an actual side project i have been working on and the other 4 link to the IMDB page of the movie or TV show they're from.

Contact: This is all made from standard bootstrap elements without much modification needed. The name and email have placeholder text and the color of the submit button was changed to match the header.
