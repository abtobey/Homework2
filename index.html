                  I'm originally from Austin, TX but have lived in the Dallas area for the last 10 years. I live with my wife Lauren and our two dogs, River and Buster. River is a 10 year old female chihuahua/beagle/some other stuff mix, and Buster is an 8 year old male Boston Terrier. I am a fan of the Cowboys, Rangers, Mavs and Aggies.</p>
                <p> I graduated from Texas A&M in 2009 with a degree in Manufacturing & Mechanical Engineering Technology and worked as an industrial engineer until 2020, the last 6 years with UPS. During that time, I established myself as the excel guy and created numerous pseudo-apps using excel, VBA and SQL that will last much longer there than I did. In the time I had between quitting my job and starting this bootcamp, I worked on a personal project to familiarize myself with javascript as much as posible, and intend to continue working on it. That project is a simulation of the type of automation machinery used by UPS, Fedex, the USPS and many others to sort packages and how it performs under various parameters. That is still very much a work in progress, but that link of the portfolio page is actually real. </p>
                <p>  My favorite hobby is playing Magic the Gathering, I have been playing for almost 20 years, I was hardcore about it and played on the Pro Tour in the early 2010s, but am more of a casual player nowadays.</p>
                <p>  I love tacos. Any kind of tacos. I'm not a snob aout it, I like traditional tacos from hole in the wall places that also serve as grocery stores and have mismatching tables and chairs, and also non-traditional tacos like Torchy's and Velvet Taco, and even Taco Bell if I'm in a hurry and/or nobody is around to judge me. </p>
